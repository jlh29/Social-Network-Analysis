# Social-Network-Analysis

This initial code will read from a file or stream (and eventually directly from Twitter if necessary) to plot the posts based on several configurable factors. 

  In addition, sometime soon, there will be some form of interactability through mouse input.


UPDATE:
I have currently added the ability to read from a (specially formatted) CSV file and to plot the data onto a map with informative popups (that will later be updated to be more useful). 
Next will be to work with Phil to get a line graph working.
